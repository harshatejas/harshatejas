# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Harsha Tejas!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate **Computer Vision Developer** with a strong focus on **Deep Learning** and **Core Computer Vision**. I specialize in building cutting-edge solutions that leverage machine learning, deep learning, and advanced vision techniques to solve complex real-world problems.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the tools, frameworks, and libraries I work with:

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, OpenCV
- **Computer Vision**: Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Tracking
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Programming Languages**: Python, CUDA
- **Cloud/Deployment**: AWS, Nvidia Jetson Devices, Raspberry Pi

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **AI-Driven Solutions**: Developing intelligent systems using deep learning techniques for object detection, facial recognition, and scene understanding tasks.
- **Research & Development**: Exploring the latest advancements in computer vision and deep learning, contributing to research, and implementing state-of-the-art models.
- **Model Optimization**: Improving the performance of computer vision models, reducing latency, and optimizing for deployment on embedded devices or edge computing.
- **Custom Solutions**: Creating custom-tailored solutions for image and video analysis, OCR, augmented reality, and more.

## ðŸ“š Current Projects

- **Transformer based video action classification**: Developing a transformer-based model for classifying actions in video sequences. This project aims to leverage the power of transformer architectures for video understanding, enabling accurate action recognition and classification in real-time video feeds. The model is designed to capture long-range dependencies in video data, providing improved performance over traditional methods.
